# Frontend Mentor – Product Preview Card Component


## Overview

This is a solution to the Product Preview Card Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of this project is to build a responsive product card component that closely matches the provided design.

The component displays product information, pricing, and an interactive "Add to Cart" button while maintaining responsiveness across desktop and mobile screen sizes.



## The challenge

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout depending on their device screen size
* See hover and focus states for interactive elements
* View different product images for desktop and mobile screens

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS3
* Flexbox
* Responsive Design techniques
* Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Structuring semantic HTML using `<main>` for accessibility
* Working with multiple images for responsiveness (desktop and mobile versions)
* Using Flexbox for layout alignment
* Styling buttons and adding hover effects
* Managing typography hierarchy using `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and `p`
* Creating a price section with both current and slashed prices

I also learned how to properly organize CSS class naming for better readability and maintainability.



### Continued development

Going forward, I want to:

* Improve my CSS responsiveness without relying on multiple image tags
* Practice using CSS Grid for layout
* Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, better alt descriptions)
* Refactor class naming using a structured methodology like BEM
* Write cleaner and more scalable CSS


### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) – For understanding semantic HTML and CSS properties.
* [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) – For providing practical real-world frontend challenges.
* CSS Flexbox Guide by CSS-Tricks – Helped me better understand layout positioning.


### AI Collaboration

I used AI assistance to:

* Structure this README professionally
* Improve clarity and organization of documentation
* Refine explanations for better readability

The coding and implementation were done by me, while AI was used as a supportive learning and documentation tool.
